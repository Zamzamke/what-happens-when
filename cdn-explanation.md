Understanding Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
Introduction:
CDNs are integral to modern web infrastructure, optimizing content delivery and enhancing user experience globally.

What is a CDN?
CDNs distribute web content (images, videos, scripts) across a network of servers worldwide to improve speed and reliability.

How CDNs Work:

Content Distribution: Copies of content are stored on servers (edge servers) strategically placed closer to users.

Caching: CDNs use caching to store frequently accessed content locally, reducing latency and server load.

Request Routing: Requests are routed to the nearest edge server based on network proximity, ensuring faster response times.

Benefits of Using CDNs:

Improved Performance: Significantly reduces page load times and enhances overall website performance.

Global Scalability: Handles high traffic volumes and spikes efficiently, ensuring consistent user experience worldwide.

Enhanced Security: Provides DDoS mitigation, SSL/TLS encryption, and protection against vulnerabilities.
